\
## What is NewsApp?\
check it out here:  [NewsApp](https://enigmatic-garden-27179.herokuapp.com/)\
\
> NewsApp is a mongoose based web scraper that tracks the latest headlines from NPR. Users can scrape the newest headlines, add comments to them, and delete their comments. Users can also delete their saved headlines and being all over again!.\
\
## Usage\
1. Available and hosted on Heroku, link above.\
2. If you are running the application locally, be sure to run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`.\
\
## Future Updates\
I do not consider this web application complete at this time. Some up-coming features that I mean to implement shortly:\
\
* Fix the save note feature: correctly be able to display, add more notes, and delete the note\
* Polish the UI and create more interactivity \
\
## Changelog Timeline\
* 18-Mar-2018: initial deployment\
