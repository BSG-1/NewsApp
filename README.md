## What is NewsApp?
check it out here:  [NewsApp](https://enigmatic-garden-27179.herokuapp.com/)

> NewsApp is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz allowing people "to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)".

----
## Usage
1. Available and hosted on Heroku, link above.
2. If you are running the application locally, be sure to run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js`.

----
## Future Updates
I do not consider this web application complete at this time. Some up-coming features that I mean to implement shortly:

* Fix the save note feature: correctly be able to display, add more notes, and delete the note
* Polish the UI and create more interactivity

## Changelog Timeline
* 18-Mar-2018: initial deployment
